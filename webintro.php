        As a certified website developer, I have over 10+ years of experience in designing &amp; building 
        websites. From utilizing WordPress and PhP, to Ruby on Rails and informational HTML websites.
        I can equip myself with libraries of existing CSS &amp; JS libraries, but primary focus on designing my 
        own libraries with each client. I take the time to get to know my clients and truly understand their 
        needs &amp; desires of having a website. And no two companies are alike. My fees and services ranges 
        based upon each client as well as the features they need/want. But, how can I assist you?<br/>

                When it comes to getting my website work online for everyone to see and access, I have 2 different methods about doing this. 
                The reason I have 2 different methods is to better cater to everyone's goals and needs for their company. And both of them are 
                pretty straight forward. Let's discuss these options now.<br/>
                <strong>I Host</strong><br/> 
                In short, I utilize one of my cloud hosting providers in order to put your website on a computer and allow other people to 
                see and use your website. The two primary cloud hosting providers I use are;<br/>
                <code style="background-color: #000; color: #0F0;">
                    * DigitalOcean<br/>
                    * Vultr<br/>
                </code>
                With that being said, let's look at the second option.<br/>
                <strong>You Host</strong><br/> 
                I can setup your website on your desired cloud hosting platform, or use your in-office server. Either way 
                I am capable of handling this aspect to allow your company to use your new website.
