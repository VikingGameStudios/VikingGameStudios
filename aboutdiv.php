        Hello and welcome to Viking Game Studios. <br/>
        Our journey begins in 2023, when programmer Aubrey W. Love II (AKA Celtic Viking) had reignited that passion to build video games.
        When he first started his college days, it was at Weatherford College for Game Design & Development. However, his family instructed him 
        to stop pursuing that dream as he will never be able to make a living with it. So instead, he went out and pursued his PhD in order to 
        make his family proud. And unable to secure a position with a company in programming, he ventured off and has been running his own 
        website company for the last 10+ years. But discouraged he was not able to chase his dream, he finally sat down with his wife and informed 
        her of his strong passion. And she is supportive of his choice. She actually encouraged him to chase his dreams. And together they are helping 
        each other chase their dreams and feeding on each others hobbies.<br/>
        <strong style="color: forestgreen; text-shadow: 7px 7px 10px #C0C0C0">But... Why Video Games?</strong><br/>
        Throughout the years, Aubrey has found himself emersed with the amazing world of gaming. From traditional old-school games 
        like Mario and Zelda, to the new age games like Fortnite and Call of Duty. Everything about video games fascinates him. And the way 
        that game studios are able to make some games look so realistic is truly awe inspiring. And he wants to be apart of that genre. 
        <br/>
        <strong style="color: forestgreen; text-shadow: 7px 7px 10px #C0C0C0">Okay... How Do You Get There?</strong><br/>
        This is a very long and stressful road ahead of us. However, with dedication, practice, and determination, we can see it through until the end.
        And to help us plan this map road out completely, here is the method Aubrey is going to utilize on his new career as an Indie Game Developer.<br/>
        <code style="color: #FFF;">
            * Create Simple Games with Game Maker Studio<br/>
            * Create Medium Multiplayer Games with Game Maker Studio<br/>
            * Create Advanced Games with Game Maker Studio<br/>
            * Learn & Build Simple Games with Unity<br/>
            * Design & Build Medium Multiplayer Games with Unity<br/>
            * Cultivate a large AAA Title Game with Unity<br/>
        </code><br/>
        Seems easy right? This is one of those that are much easier said than done. However, the reward will be worth it as I progress along these steps. 
        But instead of just building 1 game in each of these steps, I am planning on creating a few different types of games within each step. The way I invision 
        this process is something like;<br/>
        <i> 
            * Create simple game from tutorial.<br/>
            * Build same game, but add my own design to it.<br/>
            * Rebuild same game, but add more levels, characters, movements, etc.<br/>
            * Build the final game complete with menu, characters, levels, rewards, sounds, and much more!<br/>
        </i><br/>
        And my progress can be found throughout this website on the <a href="gaming.php">Video Games</a> page.<br/>
        <strong style="color: forestgreen; text-shadow: 7px 7px 10px #C0C0C0">Okay... That Is Cool, But What About Websites & Mobile Apps?</strong><br/>
        An excellent question! And Aubrey will still continue to design & build websites for clients. However, dialing the 
        advertising and promotions back and just utilizing word of mouth to get clients is going to provide assistance for 
        my financial aspect. And Aubrey is planning on utilizing most of the funds from website projects to aid in purchasing 
        things he will need to design and build new, bigger, and better video games. So in short, they will feed off of each other.
