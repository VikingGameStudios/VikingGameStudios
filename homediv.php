        Viking Game Studios is a small indie firm that aims to produce exciting and new games. But that is 
        not where we stop at either! In fact, we also cater website & mobile application development services 
        for some of our business clients as well!<br/>

                An excellent question. In short, I am just a single individual who aims to produce some of the best 
                content I possibly can provide. I have over 10+ years of experience in website development utilizing 
                a multitude of different programming languages. I have nearly 2 years of mobile application development, 
                as well as about 1.5 years of game development.

                My primary focus is to start a small Indie Game Studio, as if we don't have enough of those as it is. 
                But I really want to get back into game development. After years of being told that I will not be able to 
                do anything with video games, I was forced to leave the world I grew to love and adore as a child.<br/>
                With my primary focus on building video games, and secondary focus on assisting companies with websites, 
                I am a freelancer who can provide a wide range of I.T. services for small to medium size organizations.
