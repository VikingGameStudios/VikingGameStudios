    <p class="gamedivparagraph">
        When I first started out my college days, I originally wanted to be a game developer, and took
        several courses at a local college for game development. However, I listened to my family and 
        quickly got out of this field. Never really leaving this industry, and I had enjoyed playing 
        amazing games throughout my life. And now I am coming back making games for everyone to play! 
        As I start from nothing, I am grinding my way through some basic tutorials as well as publishing 
        my games as I progress along on my learning aspect. My ultimate goal is to create a really nice big 
        time title that generates enough players that I can enjoy listening to others talk about. Not really 
        in it for financial gain, however, that would be nice. But just the satisifaction of knowing people 
        enjoy my games.<br />
        I am restarting my Game Development journey by using a simple game engine to get used to this world
        once again. And I encourage you to visit my Game Dev page and have a look at what I have already created 
        with an engine called Game Maker Studio;<br/>
